2+^h|*__C_ORDERED<T> (abstract)__*

h|*Description*
2+a|Abstract parent of primitive constrainer classes based on `Ordered` base types, i.e. types like `Integer`, `Real`, and the Date/Time types. The model constraint is a List of Intervals, which may include point Intervals, and acts as a efficient and formally tractable representation of any number of point values and/or contiguous intervals of an ordered value domain.

In its simplest form, the constraint accessor returns just a single point `Interval<T>` object, representing a single value.

The next simplest form is a single proper `Interval <T>` (i.e. normal two-sided or half-open interval). The most complex form is a list of any combination of point and proper intervals.

|*constraint*: `link:/releases/BASE/{am_release}/foundation_types.html#_list_class[List^]<link:/releases/BASE/{am_release}/foundation_types.html#_interval_class[Interval^]>`
a|Constraint in the form of a List of Intervals of the parameter type T. Concrete types generated in descendants via template binding.

|*default_value*: `T`
a|Default value set in a template, and present in an operational template. Generally limited to leaf and near-leaf nodes.

__Post__: `Result = constraint.is_empty`
a|True if any value (i.e. instance) of the reference model type would be allowed. Redefined in descendants.

): `link:/releases/BASE/{am_release}/foundation_types.html#_boolean_class[Boolean^]`
a|True if `_other.any_allowed_` or else for every constraint in the `_constraint_` list there is a constraint in `_other.constraint_` that contains it.

other: `<<_c_ordered_class,C_ORDERED>>[1]` +

a|True if the items in `_constraint_` are equal in number and identical pair-wise with those in `_other.constraint_`.
