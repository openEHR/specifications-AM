== AOM Type Substitutions

The `C_OBJECT` types defined in <<constraint_model_top>> are reproduced below, with concrete types that may actually occur in archetypes shown in dark yellow / non-italic.

Within a specialised archetype, nodes that redefine corresponding nodes in the parent are normally of the same `C_OBJECT` type (we can think of this as a 'meta-type', since the RM type is the 'type' in the information model sense), but in some cases may also be of different `C_OBJECT` types.

The rules for meta-type redefinition are as follows:

* A node of each meta-type can be redefined by a node of the same meta-type, with narrowed / added constraints;
* `ARCHETYPE_SLOT` can be redefined by:
** one or more `C_ARCHETYPE_ROOT` nodes taken together, considered to define a 'filled' version of the slot;
** an `ARCHETYPE_SLOT` , in order to close the slot.
* A `C_ARCHETYPE_ROOT` node can be redefined by:
** A `C_ARCHETYPE_ROOT` , where the archetype_ref of the redefining node is a specialisation of that mentioned in the parent node.
* A 'terminal' `C_COMPLEX_OBJECT` node containing no constraint other than RM type, `_node_id_` and possibly occurrences (i.e. having no substructure), can be redefined by a constraint of any other AOM type other than `C_PRMITIVE_OBJECT`.

The 'terminal' `C_COMPLEX_OBJECT` can be understood as a placeholder node primarily defined for the purpose of stating RM type and meaning (at-code/id-code).
