= Model Overview

The model described here is a pure object-oriented model that can be used with archetype parsers and software that manipulates archetypes and templates in memory. It is typically the output of a parser of any serialsed form of archetypes. 

== Used BASE Component Packages

The AOM is dependent on various packages from the the openEHR BASE component. The first of these is the `base.foundation_types` package, which defines the various 'leaf' types assumed by the AOM as well as other utility types and basic data structures, such as the `Interval<T>` type. These types are documented in the {openehr_foundation_types}[openEHR Foundation Types specification] and reproduced below for convenience.

NOTE: the above types do not constitute a formal part of this specification. Any implementation of the AOM will typically have to use concrete versions of these types found within languages and/or libraries.

In addition, various definitions from the `base.base_types.definitions` package are reused, which are shown below.

The enumeration type `VALIDITY_KIND` is provided in order to define standard values representing `mandatory`, `optional`, or `disallowed` in any model. It is used in this model in classes such as `C_DATE` , `C_TIME` and `C_DATE_TIME`. The `VERSION_STATUS` enumeration type serves a similar function within various AOM types.

Other classes used from the BASE Component include the `base.resource` package, which includes the class `AUTHORED_RESOURCE` and subordinate classes. These are shown by inclusion in the AOM Archetype package diagram below.

Finally, classes from the BASE Component `base.expressions` package is used by the rules part of the AOM. This is documented in the relevant section below.

== AOM2 Package Structure

The Archetype Object Model is defined by the package `am.aom2` and subordinate packages, as illustrated in <<aom_package_overview>>.

== Definition and Utility Classes

=== Overview

Various definitional constants are used in the AOM. These are defined in the `aom2.definitions` package from the AM component and are shown below.
