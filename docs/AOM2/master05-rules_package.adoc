= Archetype Rules

== Overview

Rules are represented in archetypes as BMM simple statements (`BMM_SIMPLE_STATEMENT`), whose subtypes `BMM_ASSERTION` and `BMM_ASSIGNMENT` supply the concrete forms of allowed rules. BMM assertions in turn use Boolean-valued expressions defined by the `LANG::org.openehr.bmm.expressions` package described in the {openehr_bmm}[BMM Expression Model^]. The following UML view illustrates.

The BMM assertion structure resolves to the generic Boolean-returning expression meta-type `EL_BOOLEAN_EXPRESSION`, instances of which may include references to any bound variable, as described in the {openehr_am_adl2}#_rules_section[ADL2 specification^].
